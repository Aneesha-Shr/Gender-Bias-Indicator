# Gender-Bias-Indicator
Coded in R, this program can take the link of any news article and show you real data on the gendered words used throughout. 

**How to Use**
You can download the main R file and equalize_pairs.json file directly to your computer. You will need some sort of R compiler on your machine. Ensure you have the rvest library installed. Graphs saved onto your computer will save to a file called gender-charts onto your Desktop. This can optionally be changed.

_Lines to Change_
Line 136 - Put in the exact file path for the equalize_pairs.json on your machine
Optional:
Line 130 - change the file path for the automatic save location
